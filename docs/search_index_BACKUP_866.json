It can help you get more job/ internship opportunities. There are some useful tips for you to start networking. 7.1 Timeline Step one: Systematic Outreach Have 2 contacts for each of your top 5 companies from your list Reach out to one person from each company at the same time  This will seem overwhelming at first but will space out over time Follow the 3B7 model of timing/tracking your outreach Step 2: Recap Focus on those in functionally-relevant positions Target Boosters (but expect Obligates &amp; Curmudgeons) Treat the process probabilistically In two hours, well have scheduled an informational meeting Part 3: Convince Advocates We still arent going to sell ourselves Focus on being likable  Starts with listening Use the TIARA framework(more information would be added in coffee chat section)  Small talk  Q&amp;A  Next Steps 7.2 Alumni 7.3 Recruiters 7.4 How to write professional emails Brief: Less than 75 words Human: Connection goes first Subtle: Request advice &amp; insight, not job assistance Direct: Make your ask in the form of a question Egoless: Over half the word count is about the contact(no about me) Sincere: Define interest narrowly (your experience at Company X) and broadly (brand management in the east coast tech space) 7.5 Using LinkedIn for networking 7.6 Coffee chat  what to say Informal coffee meetings can sometimes prove the most consequential of your career. But its easy to be deceived by the casualness of an invitation to grab a coffee and imagine these opportunities are less important than they can be. They arent actually job interviews or pitch meetings, but theyre more intentional than chance conversations at networking events. 1. Know Your Desired Outcome, But Start With Small Talk You can begin with three questions:  Hows your day going so far (temp check  are they chatty)  How did you join your organization? (you dont get to talk more than 2 mins)  What are you working on right now (optional) 2. Connect by Asking Rapport Building Questions In this section, you need to ask questions that are flattering and fun to answer and you can use TIARA method in Q&amp;A.TIARA is a proven systematic approach to build like ability with other people and your guide for the Q&amp;A portion of any informational interview.
