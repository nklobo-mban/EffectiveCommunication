Usually, interview processes are between application review and final offer call which will be the step that determines whether the candidate can get an offer. If the candidate gets an interview invitation, the candidate is halfway successful in the job application. Preparing for an interview means that candidates will need to take time to thoughtfully consider his/her goals and qualifications relative to the position and employer. In order to accomplish this, the candidate must dig into the company and carefully review the job description to understand the fundamental reason that the candidate will be the best fit. 8.2 Types of Interviews 8.2.1 Phone Interviews Many companies start the interview process with a phone call to discuss the job opportunity with potential candidates to determine whether the candidate is a good fit or whether the candidate is qualified for the position. The reasons companies use phone interviews are that phone interviews are the way for recruiters to screen candidates to narrow the pool of applicants who will be invited for in-person or virtual interviews. 8.2.2 Case Interviews Case interview is the cornerstone of consulting recruitment to see whether the candidate is able to solve a business problem which could test both problem-solving skills and soft skills. Case interviews usually last 30-45 minutes, depending on the film and interview stages. Back-to-back interviews often happen in case interviews which means the candidates will need to participate in 2-3 case interviews with different interviewers on the same day. For example, a candidate could have three interviews with different leaders in the firm on the same day to perform one case interview with each interviewer. Generally, there are two styles of conduction case: Candidate-led and Interviewer-led. For candidate-led cases, the interviewer rarely intervenes which means that the candidate will lead the approach from asking clarifying questions and data, structuring the problem, drawing frameworks, and finally synthesizing to make a recommendation for the client. For interviewer-led cases, the interviewer controls the process in significant ways. The interviewers will ask candidates to work on specific parts of the case which are different from the candidate-led cases. Candidates will not be asked to solve one big problem by himself/herself, but instead, candidates will work on small questions or mini-case one at a time and finally combine together to provide a strategic recommendation for the client. 8.2.3 Behavioral Interviews Behavioral-based interview is interviewing based on discovering how candidates acted in specific business-related situations. How candidates behaved in the past will predict how candidates will behave in the future workplace which is an important part for companies to consider. In a behavioral interview, an interviewer has decided what skills are needed in the person the company hires and will ask questions to find out if the candidate has those skills. Instead of asking how candidates would behave, interviewers will ask how candidates did behave. 8.2.4 Technical Interviews Technical interviews are common for those recruiting technology or software roles. They serve as a way for employers to test one’s problem-solving skills, communication abilities, and technical expertise. These interviews typically last between 45-60 minutes and can occur at any time during the hiring process. Questions can consist of traditional behavioral questions, brainteasers, technical proficiency tests, and problem-solving questions. When assessing your answers recruiters are given a glimpse into how you may solve real problems in the workplace; therefore, it is key to explain your thought process and the mental steps you take towards your solution. 8.3 Proper Interview Follow-Up Methods 8.3.1 The Thank-You Note Each time you interact with a new interviewer, it is a good idea to send a thank-you email within 24-48 hours of the meeting. These emails should be short and sweet, focused on demonstrating excitement and appreciation. Subject line: Thank you for your time Dear Ms. Owekwe, Thank you for taking the time to speak with me about the marketing coordinator role. It was great to meet with you and learn more about the position.

Thanks again, Jerry Mendelson 555-555-5555 jerrym@email.com 8.3.2 The Follow-Up Note It is important to give your recruiter time to respond. It is recommended that you wait at least a week after the expected reply date to send a message, if you have not yet heard back from a recruiter. The message should be no more than three paragraphs and the content should be similar to your thank-you note; make sure to express excitement about the role and ask if any additional information is needed.

The message should be brief, thanking the interviewer for their time and asking for constructive feedback on how to improve. Often recruiters may not take the time to give you feedback, but in certain situations it can open the doors for new opportunities.

T - I was tasked with researching, demonstrating, and presenting several pre-selected systems to the executive team with my recommendation for the optimal choice. After weeks of due diligence and research I had a recommendation I was happy with. A - After the initial presentation, I was told that the executive team wanted to explore other options and that I was to research other systems. I was discouraged but went back and re-evaluated all systems within the industry, primarily focusing on ease of accessibility for scientists, integration into our current system of quickbooks, and the overall cost for the first three years. R - After presenting all my research to various executives, they were pleased and chose my recommendation. It was actually really cool because in the last week of my internship I was able to see the rollout of the system, and it was extremely rewarding. I was taught to not be discouraged after a single failure and the ability to persevere. Brotherhood Chair through Covid S - I was positioned during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as the brotherhood chair of my professional business fraternity. T - We had scheduled and budgeted events for the entire semester, but had to move events virtually and found an glaring lack of attendance at the beginning as we attempted to continue with our original plans A - My co-chair was a newly-joined member and had not experienced previous in-person brotherhood events, so I took it upon myself to schedule meetings with the co-chair as well as the VP of membership to discuss shortcomings and marketing failures. We created a new wave of events focused on member interaction, for example we hosted a virtual talent show that was a huge success. I got to watch one of my best friends freestyle and got to see a side of people I had never seen before. R - With the excitement of events like these we were able to triple our member engagement from the beginning of the pandemic. I was also able to use my newly gained knowledge of virtual events to help the philanthropy chair and the professional chairs respectively in boosting engagement in a virtual 5K and a virtual speaker panel. Redefine Clothing Brand S - Seeing the rise in AAPI hate crimes and anti-asian sentiment across America, my two closest friends and I created a clothing brand, Redefine Worldwide, which works to redefine Asian Stereotypes. T - For the past 6 months i’ve been working to help create our first merchandise collection, which just February 1st on Chinese New Year A - To do this I set up our shopify website, created designs and mocks, worked to expand our social media marketing, and sourced a manufacturer that has worked with the likes of Kanye West and Young Thug. R - The culmination of these things has allowed us to generate above $600 in pre-sale profit, and at the end of the month a percentage of our total sales will be donated to ACT TO CHANGE, a nonprofit working to combat AAPI hate crimes. 8.7 Interview Tips Carefully examine the job description Consider why you are interviewing and your qualifications Research on the company and role Clarify your “selling points” and the reasons you want the job Consider your answers to common interview questions Arrange enough time to prepare different types of interviews Conducting mock interviews with real person helps Practice your speaking voice and body language Prepare thoughtful questions for the interviewer Get ready to follow up after the interview Practice, practice, practice!
