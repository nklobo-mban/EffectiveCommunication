## Resume
Your resume describes your qualifications and what makes you unique. To stand out among other applicants, you need a resume that markets your strengths and match for the job.
  It’s easy to create a resume that looks like everyone else’s. But to win that interview, you need to go beyond the standard approach. Here are four strategies that will get your resume noticed:

## Cover Letter

Cover letters are an often overlooked part of the job-hunting process. Many of us think they're not necessary or that hiring managers don't read them. However, an eye-catching cover letter can make the difference between your job application going in the interview pile or the rejection pile. A well-written cover letter will entice a potential employer to take a closer look at your resume.

* Traditional Cover Letter
If you're submitting a printed copy of your cover letter, you should use the format of a [traditional business letter](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/writing/how-to-write-a-letter.html). Don't forget to add a handwritten signature and note that you're enclosing a copy of your resume.

* Email Cover Letter
If you're submitting your cover letter in the body of an email, you don't need to include address information at the top or use the enclosure notation to indicate that your resume is attached to the message.

While an email letter is more informal, you should still write your email in a [professional tone](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-cover-letters.html).

LinkedIn users create professional, resume-like profiles that allow other site members to learn more about their business background, areas of expertise and professional development organization memberships. Once users create a profile, they can add other users to their network.

The profiles also include status updates that let people in a user’s network know what they’re working on and when they might be traveling. There is also a feature that allows people who are not signed in to LinkedIn to view parts of a user’s public profile.

LinkedIn business profiles are for organizations seeking to hire, generate leads, grow and market their business, and more. LinkedIn also offers solutions and resources for businesses of all sizes.
