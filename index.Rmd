# Welcome
This website is a user friendly guide that prospective, current, and former MBAn and Ross students can utilize when they are looking to apply for different analytics positions that are available in the job market. 

The MBAn program is an accelerated fast-paced program that is designed to teach students hard technical and business skills to be able to succeed in a business analyst position. Because of the fast-paced environment, the curriculum cannot cover everything. This website is designed to educate MBAn students and alumni as well as Ross students about different analytical positions and how to communicate effectively during the networking and recruiting process. It is designed to be a resource where students can find information about how to prepare for different types of interviews to ensure that the students are effectively communicating themselves and their brand to secure the best job possible. 

To help students prepare for the  job recruiting process this website has an analytics and data toolbox where students can learn more about different analytics and data terminology and software. The website also provides students with a list of different analytic jobs and information for how students can create strong application materials to ensure that they are effectively communicating their skills and strengths to recruiters and companies. 

To build this website, Team 4Ward has R.Markdown and collaborated by using  GitHub.  Additionally, the team has used resources from the Career Development Office at the Ross School of Business. The team has also compiled and analyzed information from a variety of different resources to create a user-friendly guide that students can use to develop their networking and communication skills to help them get a data or business analytics job.
