  + Designing and maintaining data systems and databases, including troubleshooting potential issues 
  + Mining and cleaning data in preparation for analysis

  + To be effective in their roles, data analysts must possess the technical skills necessary for data mining, hygiene, and analysis, along with strong interpersonal skills to communicate their findings to decision-makers. 

A bachelor’s degree in a related field is typically required for entry-level data analysts. For senior positions, hiring managers often require or strongly prefer a graduate degree such as a master’s degree in analytics. 

Required skills: 

## Data Scientist

Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations.

Data scientists are analytical experts who utilize their skills in both technology and social science to find trends and manage data. They use industry knowledge, contextual understanding, skepticism of existing assumptions – to uncover solutions to business challenges.

A data scientist’s work typically involves making sense of messy, unstructured data, from sources such as smart devices, social media feeds, and emails that don’t neatly fit into a database.

### SQL (MySQL) {#SQL}

SQL, Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.
