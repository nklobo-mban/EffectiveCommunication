## Andy Chen

What’s up everyone! I’m Andy Chen and I was born and raised in the Bay Area in Foster City, California. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Michigan and am currently a Master of Business Analytics student at the Ross School of Business. I chose to pursue a degree in Business Analytics as I wished to supplement the theoretical knowledge I gained from my Economics degree with stronger data analytics skills.

Outside of school I enjoy spending time with friends. Back home we often go fishing at Bass Lake, and, although I haven’t gone yet in Michigan, I would love to sometime this year. I have a dog named Aaron and he is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel; he’s a good dog. I am also an avid fan of professional poker strategy and love watching/playing the game.
