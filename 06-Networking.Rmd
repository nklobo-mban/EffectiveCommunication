# Networking

In this section, we would talk about networking.Networking is the process of making connections and building relationships. It can help you get more job/ internship opportunities. There are some useful tips for you to start networking.

## Timeline

**Step one: Systematic Outreach**

Have 2 contacts for each of your top 5 companies from your list
Reach out to one person from each company at the same time

– This will seem overwhelming at first but will space out over time

Follow the “3B7” model of timing/tracking your outreach

**Step 2: Recap**

Focus on those in functionally-relevant positions

Target Boosters (but expect Obligates & Curmudgeons)

Treat the process probabilistically

In two hours, we’ll have scheduled an informational meeting

We still aren’t going to sell ourselves

Focus on being likable

## Alumni

## Recruiters

## How to write professional emails

1. Brief: Less than 75 words

2. Human: Connection goes first

3. Subtle: Request advice & insight, not job assistance

4. Direct: Make your ask in the form of a question

5. Egoless: Over half the word count is about the contact(no ‘about me’)

6. Sincere: Define interest narrowly (“your experience at Company X”) and broadly (“brand management in
the east coast tech space”)

## Using LinkedIn for networking 

## Coffee chat – what to say

Informal coffee meetings can sometimes prove the most consequential of your career. But it’s easy to be deceived by the casualness of an invitation to grab a coffee and imagine these opportunities are less important than they can be. They aren’t actually job interviews or pitch meetings, but they’re more intentional than chance conversations at networking events.

**1. Know Your Desired Outcome, But Start With Small Talk**

You can begin with three questions:

– How’s your day going so far (temp check – are they chatty)

– How did you join your organization? (you don’t get to talk more than 2 mins)

– What are you working on right now (optional)

**2. Connect by Asking Rapport Building Questions**

In this section, you need to ask questions that are flattering and fun to answer and you can use TIARA method in Q&A.TIARA is a proven systematic approach to build like ability with other people and your guide for the Q&A portion of any informational interview.

**TIARA Question Examples**

T-Trends: Try to make trend questions specific to the company, industry or function for the person you are interviewing. 

Example Questions:

– “What are the big things your company is thinking about?”

– “How are changing consumer trends affecting your company’s
products?”

– “How is your company keeping pace with all the innovation in the
Industry?”

– “How is your company leveraging technology like VR?

Insights: “What surprises you most about your work?”

Advice: “What do you know now that you’d wish you knew as a student?”

Resources: “What resources do you recommend I look into next?”

Assignments: “What kinds of experience, paid or unpaid,would you encourage for anybody pursuing a career in this field?”
