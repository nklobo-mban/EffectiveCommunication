# Networking

In this section, we would talk about networking.Networking is the process of making connections and building relationships. It can help you get more job/ internship opportunities. There are some useful tips for you to start networking.

## Timeline

**Step one: Systematic Outreach**

Have 2 contacts for each of your top 5 companies from your list
Reach out to one person from each company at the same time

– This will seem overwhelming at first but will space out over time

Follow the “3B7” model of timing/tracking your outreach

**Step 2: Recap**

Focus on those in functionally-relevant positions

Target Boosters (but expect Obligates & Curmudgeons)

Treat the process probabilistically

In two hours, we’ll have scheduled an informational meeting

**Part 3: Convince Advocates**

We still aren’t going to sell ourselves

Focus on being likable

– Starts with listening

Use the TIARA framework(more information would be added in coffee chat section)

– Small talk

– Q&A

– Next Steps

## Alumni

## Recruiters

## How to write professional emails

1. Brief: Less than 75 words

2. Human: Connection goes first

3. Subtle: Request advice & insight, not job assistance

4. Direct: Make your ask in the form of a question

5. Egoless: Over half the word count is about the contact(no ‘about me’)

6. Sincere: Define interest narrowly (“your experience at Company X”) and broadly (“brand management in
the east coast tech space”)

## Using LinkedIn for networking 

## Coffee chat – what to say

Informal coffee meetings can sometimes prove the most consequential of your career. But it’s easy to be deceived by the casualness of an invitation to grab a coffee and imagine these opportunities are less important than they can be. They aren’t actually job interviews or pitch meetings, but they’re more intentional than chance conversations at networking events.

**1. Know Your Desired Outcome, But Start With Small Talk**

You can begin with three questions:

– How’s your day going so far (temp check – are they chatty)

– How did you join your organization? (you don’t get to talk more than 2 mins)

– What are you working on right now (optional)

**2. Connect by Asking Rapport Building Questions**
