# GO 4WARD!

Intro 

## The Process 
### Development of our Project Idea 
### Utlizing R.Markdown and GitHub 
### Acquiring User Stories 
 A third of the way through the development of this project, we conducted interviews with our peers and other Ross students to get an understanding of what type of information the users of this website want and what resources and tools would be helpful to them. 
 
Throughout this process, we found that students do not need to learn how to communicate and collaborate effectively but they want to learn how to communicate effectively when they are networking, writing their resumes, and interviewing for different jobs. This includes learning about specific vocabulary related to data and analytics. Through this interview process we asked our users about what information and resources they felt were not available to them. Once we completed these interviews we met as a team and decided to change the scope of our project.
